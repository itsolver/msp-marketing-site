      <h2>Why Backup Is Essential for Your Personal Data</h2>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Data Loss Prevention</h3>
        <p>Protect against accidental deletion, hardware failure, theft, or ransomware attacks that could wipe out your precious memories and documents.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Peace of Mind</h3>
        <p>Know that your important personal files, photos, and memories are safely stored and can be recovered when needed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Project Continuity</h3>
        <p>Ensure your personal projects can continue uninterrupted even after unexpected data loss.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Personal Record Keeping</h3>

<!-- Why Cloud Storage Isn't Enough -->

      <h2>Why OneDrive or Google Drive Aren't True Backup Solutions</h2>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Sync vs. Backup</h3>
        <p>Cloud storage services like OneDrive and Google Drive primarily sync your files, meaning if you delete a file locally, it's also deleted in the cloud. True backup solutions preserve deleted files.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Protection for Creative Work</h3>
        <p>If you're writing a book, creating art, or working on important personal projects, you need versioning and protection that standard cloud storage doesn't provide.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Disaster Protection</h3>
        <p>In case of fire, theft, or natural disasters affecting your home, having an independent backup separate from your primary cloud storage provides an essential safety net.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Ransomware Protection</h3>
        <p>If your computer is infected with ransomware, synced cloud storage can also become encrypted. Dedicated backup solutions offer better protection against these threats.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Account Security</h3>
        <p>If your cloud storage account is compromised or locked, you could lose access to all your files. A separate backup solution provides redundancy.</p>

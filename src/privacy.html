<h4>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>
<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>
<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with IT Solver or an IT Solver affiliated company. IT Solver and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information IT Solver may collect and how we may use it:</p>

<h4>What personal information we collect</h4>
<ul class="terms">
    <li>When you register with IT Solver, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.</li>
    <li>When you share your content with family and friends using IT Solver products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in IT Solver services or forums, IT Solver may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. IT Solver will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.</li>
    <li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How we use your personal information</h4>
<ul class="terms">
    <li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on IT Solver's latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by clicking the unsubscribe link in the marketing email.</li>
    <li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.
    </li>
    <li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services. For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of IT Solver account holders.
    </li>
    <li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with IT Solver, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
    </li>
    <li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve IT Solver's products, services, and customer communications.
    </li>
    <li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h4>
<ul class="terms">
    <li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an IT Solver product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>
    <li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

<h4>Cookies and Other Technologies</h4>
<p>IT Solver's websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>IT Solver and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with IT Solver more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the IT Solver Online Store. Knowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.</p>
